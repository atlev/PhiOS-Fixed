[Latest Release](https://github.com/atlev/PhiOS-Fixed/releases/latest)
***

This is the first (base) version of PhiOS, which provides cell rendering, cell stacking/layers,
foreground & background colors, cell transition animations, bitmap font support & rudimentary mouse input.

The layered windowing system and scrollable UI widgets are not included in this release (yet).
All that stuff will be in future extended versions. SOONâ„¢

Note: PhiOS does NOT include any post-processing image effects (all that fancy stuff like scanlines,
bloom, CRT monitor distortion, glitches etc... that you may have seen on previous screenshots).
These are all provided by third party plugins, please see the Third Party Effects section below
if you want to replicate your display to look like this.

Disclaimer: There will probably be bugs and incomplete/missing features! This engine was always intended
to be part of a larger game project, and not as a tool released to the public. However, I'm putting it
out there anyway due to popular request. Code is provided as-is.
